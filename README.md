# ShapeOutput
This is a simple project in which it is to assist me in learning some of the basics of the python programming language and how github works as I have only used BitBucket. The program will display a menu in the terminal in which the user can select a shape to make. It will then ask for a size and then will proceed to print the desired shape based on the given size in ASCII characters to the terminal.

##How to run
1) Save the file to your computer.
2) In the terminal, you will navigate to the path that you saved the file in.
3) Type "python ShapeOutput.py" and push enter.
4) Program is now running. In stop it, just select option 6 on the menu or close the terminal.
