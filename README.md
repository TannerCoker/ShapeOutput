# ShapeOutput
This is a simple project in which it is to assist me in learning some of the basics of the python programming language. The program will display menu in the terminal in which the user can select a shape to make. It will then ask for a size and then will proceed to print the desired shape based on the given size in ASCII characters to the terminal.
